<h1>DiscordLookup</h1>

DiscordLookup is a web-based application that allows you to easily lookup Discord user IDs and retrieve information about Discord users. This is especially useful for Discord server owners and administrators who need to verify the identities of their members or for anyone who needs to quickly retrieve information about a particular Discord user.

In addition to the ID lookup feature, DiscordLookup also has a bot add feature. By navigating to /bot/<bot_id>, you will be redirected to the Discord bot invite page where you can easily add the bot to your server.

The website is built using Node.js and EJS, making it fast, efficient, and easy to use.
